          <h1 class="page-title">The Importance Of Recycling!</h1>
          <p>
                Recycling is one of the best ways for you to have a positive impact on the world in which we live. Recycling is important to both the natural environment and us. We must act fast as the amount of waste we create is increasing all the time. The amount of rubbish we create is constantly increasing because:

                <br><br>Increasing wealth means that people are buying more products and ultimately creating more waste. Increasing population means that there are more people on the planet to create waste. New packaging and technological products are being developed, much of these products contain materials that are not biodegradable. New lifestyle changes, such as eating fast food, means that we create additional waste that isn&#8217;t biodegradable.
                
                
                
                <br><br><strong>Recycling Sites at VSU:</strong>
                
                    <br><br>&emsp;On the corner of Powell Hall, Bio Chem Building and Pedestrian Mall.
                    <br>&emsp;Just west of Converse Hall, facing Hopper Hall.
                    <br>&emsp;On the grass, just south of Brown Hall, facing Lowndes Hall. (this will service the Patterson residents, also)
                    <br>&emsp;In the interior quad area of Centennial Hall(s); east and west.
                
                
                
                    <br><br><strong>Valdosta State University's Recycling Initiatives</strong> 
                
                    <br><br>Two Student Assistants work as a “Recycling Crew” on campus.  They have been provided with a vehicle and work vests that identify them as “VSU Recycling”.  They are servicing academic buildings, food service operations and dormitory recycling sites.  Additional personnel may be hired as the program develops and if funds are available.                
                    <br><br>The University established a recycling center at the Toombs St. entrance to the Bursary drive-thru.  The city donated a “Sway Car” for VSU’s use in recycling.  It is picked up whenever it becomes full and taken to the City’s recycling facility on Myrtle St.  Frequency of pickups average once every 2 – 3 weeks.
                            At the recycling center, there are City donated barrels for use by VSU to further sort material collected in the dormitories or other locations.
                    <br><br>The City has donated a dumpster for use in collecting cardboard items.  This has been added to the collection duties. This 8 cubic yard dumpster tends to be emptied every day.
                    <br><br>VSU purchased over $29,000 in recycling containers for use throughout the campus.  Additionally, a dedicated vehicle, specifically intended for recycling use has been purchased and is now in use.  Additional resources are purchased as the need is recognized.
                    <br><br>Four “Recycling Sites” are located near residence halls for use by residents.  These are intended for plastics, glass, aluminum and cans.  Material should be clean before being deposited, so as to ensure a clean and odor free environment.

            <h3>What We Do</h3>
            <p>	
                    Our goal is to encourage recycling efforts of VSU students and the greater Valdosta community by providing fun and interactive way of reducing, reusing and recycling. We believe that this project will serve the community economically and ecologically by reducing the amount of waste and energy consumption from manufacturing.
                    through our efforts we hope to provide a better tomorrow for all.
