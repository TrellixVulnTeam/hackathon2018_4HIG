          <p>
                The most effective way to reduce waste is to not create it in the first place. Making a new product requires a lot of materials and energy - raw materials must be extracted from the earth, and the product must be fabricated then transported to wherever it will be sold. As a result, reduction and reuse are the most effective ways you can save natural resources, protect the environment and save money.

                        <strong>Paper</strong>
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Paper makes up nearly 30 percent of municipal solid waste (trash) generated each year, more than any other material. Americans recycled about 65 percent of the paper they used in 2014. This recovered paper is used to make new paper products, saving trees and other natural resources. Most community or office recycling programs accept paper and paper products. Check what your community or office program accepts before you put it in the bin. When you go shopping, look for products that are made from recycled paper.

                        <strong>Batteries</strong>
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Dry-Cell Batteries are used in a variety of electronics and include alkaline and carbon zinc (9-volt, D, C, AA, AAA), mercuric-oxide (button, some cylindrical and rectangular), silver-oxide and zinc-air (button), and lithium (9-volt, C, AA, coin, button, rechargeable) batteries. Look for in-store recycling bins or community collection events to dispose of these batteries.

                        <strong>Plastics</strong>
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Americans generated 33 million tons of plastics in 2014, about 13 percent of the waste stream. Only 9.5 percent of plastics were recycled in 2013. Some types of plastics are recycled much more than others. Most community recycling programs accept some, but not all, types of plastics. Look for products made from recycled plastic materials. What do the symbols mean on the bottom of plastic bottles and containers? These symbols were created by plastic manufacturers to help people identify the kind of plastic resin used to make the container. This can help you determine if the container can be accepted by your local recycling program. The resin number is contained in a triangle, which looks very similar to the recycling symbol, but this does not necessarily mean it can be collected for recycling in your community.

                        <strong>Glass</strong>
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Glass, especially glass food and beverage containers, can be recycled over and over again. Americans generated 11.5 million tons of glass in 2014, about 26 percent of which was recovered for recycling. Making new glass from recycled glass is typically cheaper than using raw materials. Most curbside community recycling programs accept different glass colors and types mixed together, and then glass is sorted at the recovery facility. Check with your local program to see if you need to separate your glass or if it can be mixed together.

                        <strong>Used Oil</strong>
                                <br>

                                Never dump your used motor oil down the drain â€” the used oil from one oil change can contaminate one million gallons of fresh water. By recycling your used oil you not only help keep our water supply clean, but help reduce American dependence on foreign oil. It takes 42 gallons of crude oil, but only one gallon of used oil, to produce 2.5 quarts of new motor oil. Many garages and auto-supply stores that sell motor oil also accept oil for recycling.

                        <strong>Used Electronics</strong>

                                Electronics donation and recycling is a great way to help conserve resources and natural materials. It is important to make sure you are donating and/or recycling electronics safely and correctly. Electronics are made from valuable resources and materials that require energy to mine and manufacture. Donating or recycling electronics conserves natural resources and avoids water and air pollution.

            <h3>What We Do</h3>
            <p>Our goal is to encourage recycling efforts of VSU students and the greater Valdosta community by providing fun and interactive way of reducing, reusing and recycling. We believe that this project will serve the community economically and ecologically by reducing the amount of waste and energy consumption from manufacturing.
                    through our efforts we hope to provide a better tomorrow for all.</p>
